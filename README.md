# Prometheus Scenarios

This repo contains a collection of learning scenarios. Each scenario is meant to teach a topic through explanation and practical exercises.

Currently available scenarios:
- the [PromQL](promql/README.md) scenario is meant to teach how to use Grafana and PromQL to create dashboards


## How to add scenarios

A scenario is created in a folder at the top level of the repository and it should contain:
- instructions on how to run the learning environment locally
- as many scripts as possible to facilitate installation
- chapters focused on a topic with examples, exercises and related solutions
